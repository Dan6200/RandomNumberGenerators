# RandomNumberGenerators

## Directive
- To create a maximal length Linear Feedback Shift-Register (LFSR)... In x86-64 NASM assembly

- **Cool Fact** The Random Number (seed) in the 64-bit LFSR is only repeated after 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (2<sup>64</sup> - 1) cycles!!! In other words, roughly once every 18 quintillion times.
